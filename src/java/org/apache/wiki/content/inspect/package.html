<p>Inspection classes that allow content to be analyzed and scored
on a variety of topics, such as whether a proposed page change contains
spam. Content may be scored by initializing an {@link
org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Inspection} object and then calling the
{@link
org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Inspection#inspect(Change...)}
method. The Inspection's {@code inspect} method, in turn, iterates
through a variety of previously-configured {@link
org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Inspector} objects and calls the {@link
org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Inspector#inspect(Inspection,Change)}
method for each one. The Inspector is free to perform whatever
evaluations it wishes. Upon exit, each Inspector's {@code inspect}
method is expected to return an array of {@link
org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Finding} objects that contains the results of
the inspection.</p>
<p>Every Inspection is configured with an {@link
org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.InspectionPlan} which identifies which
Inspectors to run, and the weights to assign to each Inspector's
results.</p>
<h3>How to use the classes in this package</h3>
<p>The key classes in this package are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Inspection} is the core class in this
	package. It implements the Gang-of-Four "strategy" pattern and is
	itself quite lightweight. It is initialized by constructing a new
	Inspection object and supplying the current WikiContext and a
	previously configured {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.InspectionPlan} that defines the
	Inspector objects that conduct the inspection. The Inspection maintains
	an internal floating-point score for each Topic. A Topic score is
	incremented or decremented based on the results of {@code
	Inspection.inspect()} as described below. The float value for a Topic
	score can be retrieved at any time by calling {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Inspection getScore(Topic)}. The
	initial value is always {@code 0f}.</li>
	<li>{@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.InspectionPlan} keeps references to the
	WikiEngine, the configured Inspectors and other shared-state objects
	needed by Inspections and Inspectors. The InspectionPlan is normally
	initialized just once, as part of the WikiEngine startup. Inspectors
	are added by calling {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.InspectionPlan#addInspector(Inspector,float)},
	where the float parameter indicates the weight that should be given to
	pass/fail results returned by the Inspector's {@code inspect} method.
	The InspectionPlan persists between HTTP requests and keeps a reference
	to the {@link org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.ReputationManager}.</li>
	<li>The {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Topic} is an concept being analyzed
	during the Inspection. The "spam" topic, for example, is {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Topic#SPAM}.
	<li>The {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Inspector} interface specifies how to
	implement a particular strategy for inspecting content. The Inspector
	has just one primary method: {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Inspector#inspect(Inspection, Change)}
	which returns an array of Findings. Each Finding is constructed with the {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Topic} that the finding applies to,
	plus the {@link org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Finding.Result}
	indicates whether the inspection for the Topic passed or failed.
	Inspectors are intended to be instantiated just once, and are
	initialized via the method {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Inspector#initialize(InspectionPlan)}.
	The InspectionPlan parameter can be used to obtain references to the
	ReputationManager, WikiEngine,and WikiEngine Properties. Inspectors are
	meant to be re-used and should not keep state between invocations of <code>inspect</code>.
	Examples of Inspector implementations include the {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.ChangeRateInspector} (which determines
	whether the current user has made too many recent changes) and the
	{@link org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.LinkCountInspector} (which
	counts links).</li>
	<li>{@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Finding} objects supply instructions to
	the parent Inspection object to increment, decrement or reset the score
	for a particular topic. Each Finding is constructed with a topic (for
	example, Topic.SPAM), a {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.Finding.Result} type that indicates
	whether the test passed (which increases the score), failed (which
	decreases it) or has no effect. An optional String message passed to
	the constructor provides context for the change.</li>
	<li>The {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.ReputationManager} tracks the IP
	addresses of hosts that have modified content recently, along with the
	changes they have made. Callers (such as Inspectors) can add a host to
	the list of recent modifications by calling {@link
	org.apache.wiki.content.inspect.ReputationManager#addModifier(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest,Change)}.</li>
</ul>
