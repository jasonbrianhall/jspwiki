/**
 *  <p>Provides state information throughout the processing of a page.  A
 *  WikiContext is born when the JSP pages that are the main entry
 *  points, are invoked.  The JSPWiki engine creates the new
 *  WikiContext, which basically holds information about the page, the
 *  handling engine, and in which context (view, edit, etc) the
 *  call was done.</p>
 *  <p>A WikiContext also provides request-specific variables, which can
 *  be used to communicate between plugins on the same page, or
 *  between different instances of the same plugin.  A WikiContext
 *  variable is valid until the processing of the page has ended.  For
 *  an example, please see the Counter plugin.</p>
 *  <p>When a WikiContext is created, it automatically associates a
 *  {@link WikiSession} object with the user's HttpSession. The
 *  WikiSession contains information about the user's authentication
 *  status, and is consulted by {@link #getCurrentUser()}.
 *  object</p>
 *  <p>Do not cache the page object that you get from the WikiContext; always
 *  use getPage()!</p>
