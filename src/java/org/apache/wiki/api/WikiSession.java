/**
 * <p>Represents a long-running wiki session, with an associated user Principal,
 * user Subject, and authentication status. This class is initialized with
 * minimal, default-deny values: authentication is set to <code>false</code>,
 * and the user principal is set to <code>null</code>.</p>
 * <p>The WikiSession class allows callers to:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Obtain the authentication status of the user via
 *     {@link #isAnonymous()} and {@link #isAuthenticated()}</li>
 *   <li>Query the session for Principals representing the
 *     user's identity via {@link #getLoginPrincipal()},
 *     {@link #getUserPrincipal()} and {@link #getPrincipals()}</li>
 *   <li>Store, retrieve and clear UI messages via
 *     {@link #addMessage(String)}, {@link #getMessages(String)}
 *     and {@link #clearMessages(String)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>To keep track of the Principals each user posseses, each WikiSession
 * stores a JAAS Subject. Various login processes add or remove Principals
 * when users authenticate or log out.</p>
 * <p>WikiSession implements the {@link org.apache.wiki.event.WikiEventListener}
 * interface and listens for group add/change/delete events fired by
 * event sources the WikiSession is registered with. Normally,
 * {@link org.apache.wiki.auth.AuthenticationManager} registers each WikiSession
 * with the {@link org.apache.wiki.auth.authorize.GroupManager}
 * so it can catch group events. Thus, when a user is added to a
 * {@link org.apache.wiki.auth.authorize.Group}, a corresponding
 * {@link org.apache.wiki.auth.GroupPrincipal} is injected into
 * the Subject's Principal set. Likewise, when the user is removed from
 * the Group or the Group is deleted, the GroupPrincipal is removed
 * from the Subject. The effect that this strategy produces is extremely
 * beneficial: when someone adds a user to a wiki group, that user
 * <em>immediately</em> gains the privileges associated with that
 * group; he or she does not need to re-authenticate.
 * </p>
 * <p>In addition to methods for examining individual <code>WikiSession</code>
 * objects, this class also contains a number of static methods for
 * managing WikiSessions for an entire wiki. These methods allow callers
 * to find, query and remove WikiSession objects, and
 * to obtain a list of the current wiki session users.</p>
 * <p>WikiSession encloses a protected static class, {@link org.apache.wiki.auth.SessionMonitor},
 * to keep track of WikiSessions registered with each wiki.</p>
