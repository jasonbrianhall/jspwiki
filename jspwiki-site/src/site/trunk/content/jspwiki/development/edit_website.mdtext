Title: Edit Website

(adapted from MRUnit site)

The website uses the Apache CMS. More detailed documentation is available on 
the Apache Infrastructure pages including a quickstart guide on the
[Apache bookmarklet][] and a [reference manual][]. It is also useful to look at
[other Apache CMS sites][] for examples.

## Process

  1. Commit a change to the website's source [Markdown][] files located at [Site's trunk][]. 
Before committing, test that the site still builds locally by following
[these instructions][].

    If deleting a file or changing the name of a file make a trivial edit to
lib/path.pm or lib/view.pm to force a full site rebuild. If making a simple edit
it is easier to just use the Apache bookmarklet.

  2. Wait a few minutes to get the email on the commits list that buildbot has
rebuilt the [staging website][].

  3. If the change looks ok, commit the change to the production website by one
of the following:

    * Using the Apache bookmarklet and selecting [Publish site][]
    * curl -sL http://s.apache.org/cms-cli | perl on your local machine
    * ssh -t <user\>@people.apache.org publish.pl jspwiki <your Apache ID\>

## Site content generated from source

  Some pages of the site (namely, the changelog, the release version at the 
bottom of the sidebar and the translation status) are generated from source. To 
refresh them, follow the instructions and execute the unit test at 
`$SVN/trunk/tests/org/apache/wiki/site/SiteGenerator.java`

## Posting generated content

  1. Add the path to content/extpaths.txt relative to the extpaths.txt
file to prevent the content getting deleted when the staging site is published
  2. Commit the generated content directly to the [production site svn][]
-->

## Style

  * Try to limit line length to 80 columns, fold -s <filename\> on Linux is
helpful for limiting line length
  * Use links in the [link name][] style rather than [link name][1] because it
is more difficult to match up the numbers and removing links causes all the
numbers to have to get updated
  * Indent with spaces not tabs
  * Use * for lists and indent lists by 2 spaces
