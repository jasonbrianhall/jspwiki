  * **23-Jan-2012:** The previous attempt to graduate to an ASF top-level 
project did not succeed for various reasons. A new effort is started to 
graduate with a 2.9 codebase (based on 2.8), so no JCR backend and no Stripes, 
but the traditional JSPWiki, the progress can still be followed at our 
[JIRA][] issue tracker.

project, the progress can be followed at our JIRA issue tracker.

  * **24-Apr-2009:** Well, it seems that it took a few more weeks to actually 
make the release - and we ain't there yet. But Harry Metske and Florian 
Holeczek joined the PPMC, which is of course good news.

  * **29-Jun-2008:** JSPWiki trunk is now completely Apache-licensed, and we're
