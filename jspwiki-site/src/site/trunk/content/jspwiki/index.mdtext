Title: Apache JSPWiki (Incubating)

## Welcome to Apache JSPWiki

Apache JSPWiki is a leading open source WikiWiki engine, feature-rich 
and built around standard J2EE components (Java, servlets, JSP). 

Some of its features include:

  * WikiMarkup/Structured Text
  * File attachments 
  * Templates support
  * Data storage through your choice of three WikiPage Providers, with the 
capability to create and plug in new ones
  * Security: fine grained control over authorization and authentication, yet 
simple to configure
  * Easy plugin interface
  * UTF-8 support
  * JSP-based
  * Easy-ish installation
  * Page locking to prevent editing conflicts
  * Support for Multiple Wikis

## Project status

  * **15-May-2013:** Official [Apache JSPWiki 2.9.1-incubating release][] is out!

  * **04-Jan-2013:** new committer and PPMC member - Glen Mazza
  
  * **01-Dec-2012:** Official Apache JSPWiki 2.9.0-incubating release is out!

  * **01-Nov-2012:** New mentor - Siegfried Goeschl.

  * **01-May-2012:** New, yet familiar, project website.

  * **23-Jan-2012:** The previous attempt to graduate to an ASF top-level 
project did not succeed for various reasons. A new effort is started to 
graduate with a 2.9 codebase (based on 2.8), so no JCR backend and no Stripes, 
but the traditional JSPWiki, the progress can still be followed at our 
[JIRA][] issue tracker.

## Disclaimer

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review 
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process 
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully 
endorsed by the ASF.
