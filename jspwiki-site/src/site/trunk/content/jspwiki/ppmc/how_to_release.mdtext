## First time release managers

  1. Generate [PGP code signing keys][]
  2. Add the PGP code signing keys to the [KEYS file][] as documented on the 
[Infrastructure site][]
  3. Put in a [Infrastructure JIRA][] asking to get added to the incubator unix 
group on people.apache.org <!--and the jspwiki deployer role for Nexus-->
  4. Copy the modified KEYS file to the release folder 
/www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/jspwiki on people.apache.org and ensure it 
has 0664 permissions.

<!---
  5. Add the following to your Maven settings.xml file:

        <servers>
          <server>
            <id>apache.releases.https</id>
            <username>APACHE-ID</username>
            <password>APACHE-PASSWORD</password>
          </server>
        </servers>
-->
It is convenient to [setup the ssh keys][] on people.apache.org, otherwise 
you'll have to enter your login password a number of times.

## Create a release candidate

  1. Generate release notes


<!-- TODO
     What exactly do we want to do here?
     Completing the details makes only sense once we're a TLP and thus not dependent from externs anymore.
     At the moment, we can only "release" in JIRA after being sure the IPMC release vote succeeded, but at that time, the artifacts have already been created.
     
 
    1. Update ReleaseNotes with [new release notes from JIRA][], select the 
version and set the style to Text
    2. Commit the updated ReleaseNotes with message: "Preparing for release 
X.Y.Z-incubating"
-->
  
<!---
  2. Create a branch (only required for the first release in a series (X.Y.0))

    1. Create a branch for the X.Y release series

            svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/trunk \
            https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/branches/jspwiki-X.Y -m "Branching for X.Y releases"

    2. Bump the version number in trunk and commit (the update-versions script 
mangles the whitespace in the root XML element):

            sed -i "" -e "s/X.Y.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/X.Y+1.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/" pom.xml

    3. Checkout the release branch:

            svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/branches/jspwiki-X.Y

  3. Remove -SNAPSHOT from the release branch and commit

        sed -i "" -e "s/X.Y.Z-incubating-SNAPSHOT/X.Y.Z-incubating/" pom.xml

  4. Deploy to Nexus Staging Repository

    1. Deploy artifact:

            mvn clean deploy -Psign

    2. Verify licenses in target/rat.txt

    3. Login to <https://repository.apache.org> and select Staging Repositories 
on the left under Build Promotion.
    4. Select org.apache.jspwiki from the list of repositories, select the 
current repository and delete any asc.md5/asc.sha1 files. Then click Close 
using "Apache JSPWiki X.Y.Z-incubating" as the description to allow others 
to see the repository.
-->
  2. Deploy source and binary distributions

    1. Build JSPWiki using Maven:

            mvn clean install -Pintegration-tests

    2. Generate the src & bin distributions using Ant:

            ant clean signeddist

    3. Copy the src distribution file and checksums to people.apache.org,
excluding the asc.md5/asc.sha1 files:

            scp target/*.tar.gz* username@people.apache.org:~/public_html/jspwiki-X.Y.Z-incubating-candidate-$RC

<!---
    3. Generate the bin distribution:

            mvn clean assembly:single gpg:sign checksum:artifacts -Pdist-bin

    4. Copy the bin distribution file and checksums to people.apache.org,
excluding the asc.md5/asc.sha1 files:

            rm target/*asc.*
            scp target/*.tar.gz* username@people.apache.org:~/public_html/jspwiki-X.Y.Z-incubating-candidate-$RC
-->
  3. Tag the release candidate:

        svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/branches/jspwiki-X.Y/ \
        https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/tags/release-X.Y.Z-incubating/ -m "jspwiki X.Y.Z-incubating release."

## Run a vote

Send the following to jspwiki-dev@incubator.apache.org and 
general@incubator.apache.org:

<!---
    Subject: [VOTE] Release JSPWiki version X.Y.Z-incubating
    
    This is an incubator release for Apache JSPWiki, version X.Y.Z-incubating.
    
    It fixes the following issues:
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310732&version=<REPLACE>
    
    *** Please download, test and vote by [3 working days after sending].
    
    Note that we are voting upon the source (tag), binaries are provided for convenience.
    
    Source and binary files:
    http://people.apache.org/~<REPLACE>/jspwiki-X.Y.Z-incubating-candidate-$RC

    Maven staging repo:
    https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachejspwiki-<REPLACE>/

    The tag to be voted upon:
    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/tags/release-X.Y.Z-incubating/
    
    JSPWiki's KEYS file containing PGP keys we use to sign the release:
    http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/jspwiki/KEYS
-->

    Subject: [VOTE] Release JSPWiki version X.Y.Z-incubating
    
    This is an incubator release for Apache JSPWiki, version X.Y.Z-incubating.
    
    It fixes the following issues:
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310732&version=<REPLACE>
    
    *** Please download, test and vote by [3 working days after sending].
    
    Note that we are voting upon the source (tag), binaries are provided for convenience.
    
    Source and binary files:
    http://people.apache.org/~<REPLACE>/jspwiki-X.Y.Z-incubating-candidate-$RC

    The tag to be voted upon:
    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/tags/release-X.Y.Z-incubating/
    
    JSPWiki's KEYS file containing PGP keys we use to sign the release:
    http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/jspwiki/KEYS
    
Note that the Incubator PMC needs to vote upon the release after a successful 
PPMC vote before any release can be made official.

## Roll Out

If the vote passes, roll out the release:

<!---
  1. Publish Nexus repository:
    1. Login to <https://repository.apache.org> and select Staging Repositories 
on the left under Build Promotion.
    2. Select the repository that was closed earlier, and click Release, using 
the description "Apache jspwiki X.Y.Z-incubating artifacts"
-->
  1. Publish src and bin distributions to the [mirrors][]:

        ssh people.apache.org
        VERSION=X.Y.Z
        PREVIOUS_VERSION=X.Y.Z
        CANDIDATE=C
        cp -r ~/public_html/jspwiki-$VERSION-incubating-candidate-$CANDIDATE \
        /www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/jspwiki/jspwiki-$VERSION-incubating
        cd /www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/jspwiki
        chgrp -R incubator jspwiki-$VERSION-incubating
        chmod -R g+w jspwiki-$VERSION-incubating
        rm -r /www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/jspwiki/jspwiki-$PREVIOUS_VERSION-incubating # remove older versions

    The last line is to remove the previous version, since only the most recent 
version on a particular branch should be in the dist directory. Older versions 
are [archived][] automatically.

  2. Wait 24 hours for mirrors to sync
  3. Post the javadoc to the site:

    1. Create the javadoc:

            mvn javadoc:javadoc

    2. Copy javadocs to https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/jspwiki/documentation/javadocs/X.Y.Z-incubating
    3. Add a link to index.html of the javadoc in the documentation/javadoc.mdtext page

  4. Post link to the full release notes along with links to the major JIRA 
changes on the front page of the site

## Announce the release

Send the following from an apache.org address to announce@apache.org, 
jspwiki-user@incubator.apache.org, jspwiki-dev@incubator.apache.org:
